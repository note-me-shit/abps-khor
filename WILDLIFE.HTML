<h1 STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER;">	WILDLIFE CONSERVATION</h1>
<p style="margin-left:6px;">Wildlife conservation refers to the practice of protecting wild species and their habitats
in order to maintain healthy wildlife species or populations and to restore, protect or
enhance natural ecosystems. Major threats to wildlife include habitat destruction,
degradation, fragmentation, overexploitation, poaching, pollution, climate change, and
the illegal wildlife trade. The IUCN estimates that 42,100 species of the ones assessed
are at risk for extinction.[1] Expanding to all existing species, a 2019 UN report on
biodiversity put this estimate even higher at a million species. It is also being
acknowledged that an increasing number of ecosystems on Earth containing endangered
species are disappearing. To address these issues, there have been both national and
international governmental efforts to preserve Earth's wildlife. Prominent conservation
agreements include the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity
(CBD).[2][3] There are also numerous nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) dedicated to conservation such as the Nature
Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and Conservation International.
