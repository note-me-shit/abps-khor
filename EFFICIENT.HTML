<p style="margin-left:6px;">Energy-efficient light bulbs last up to 12 times longer than traditional ones, giving the same
quality of light with much less energy. Traditional bulbs waste 80% of their energy as heat,
while LED bulbs are 80-90% energy-efficient. There are many benefits of LED lighting on the
environment.
