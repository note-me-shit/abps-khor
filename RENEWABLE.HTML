<p style="margin-left:6px;">Solar panels, also known as solar photovoltaic (PV) setups, turn sunlight into electricity using
special cells. This lets you create your own eco-friendly power, reducing carbon emissions
significantly.<BR>

Once set up, solar panels are emission-free, noiseless, and don't pollute the air, benefiting local
air quality and health.<BR>

You can pair solar panels with electric heating, like heat pumps, for clean warmth and hot
water.<BR>


Adding batteries to your solar setup stores energy for any time use, making you independent
of fossil fuels during outages or when the sun isn't shining.<BR>
