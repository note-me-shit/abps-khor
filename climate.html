<h1 STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER;">CLIMATE-CHANGE</h1>
<p style="margin-left:6px;">In common usage, climate change describes global warming-the ongoing
increase in global average temperature-and its effects on Earth's climate system.
Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to
Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is primarily caused by
humans burning fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use,
deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse
gases.[5] These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms
from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary
greenhouse gas driving global warming, has grown by about 50% and is at levels
unseen for millions of years.</p></div>
