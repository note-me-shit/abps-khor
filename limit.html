<h1 STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER;">LIMIT YOUR FOOD WASTE </h1>
<p style="margin-left:6px;">In 2018, the UK generated 9.5 million tonnes of food waste, equal to 25 million tonnes of
greenhouse gas emissions. Households were responsible for 70% of this waste, leading to
higher emissions from greater industrial production and transportation.<BR>

To reduce household food waste, portion meals sensibly, purchase only what's needed, a
use food waste as fertilizer for soil and plants. This can be among the best eco-friendly
practices in day-to-day life.<BR>
