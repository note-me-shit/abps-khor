<h1 STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER;">SUSTAINABLE LIVING</h1>
<p style="margin-left:6px;">Sustainable living is fundamentally the application of sustainability to lifestyle choices and
decisions. One conception of sustainable living expresses what it means in triple-bottom-line
terms as meeting present ecological, societal, and economical needs without compromising
these factors for future generations.(6]7] Another broader conception describes sustainable living
in terms of four interconnected social domains: economics, ecology, politics, and culture. In the
first conception, sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities
defined by these factors. In the second or Circles of Sustainability conception, sustainable living
can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the
interconnected domains of social life, including consequences for future human generations and
non-human species.<br>

Sustainable design and sustainable development are critical factors to sustainable living. Sustainable design encompasses the
development of appropriate technology, which is a staple of sustainable living practices.9) Sustainable development in turn is the
use of these technologies in infrastructure. Sustainable architecture and agriculture are the most common examples of this
practice.[10]
