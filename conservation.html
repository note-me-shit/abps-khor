<h1 STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER;">CONSERVATION</h1>
<p style="margin-left:6px;">Conservation is a crisis discipline, one demanded by the unusual rates of loss; it is also a mission-driven one. By
analogy, ecology and conservation have the same relationship as physiology and medicine. Human physiology studies
the workings of the human body, whereas medicine is mission-oriented and aims to understand what goes wrong and
how to treat it. The major parts of this article thus deal first with the "pathology" of extinction-why and how
biodiversity is lost-and second with the "treatment" methods to prevent these losses.<BR>

Conservation is often considered a purely biological topic, as exemplified by major scientific journals with titles such as
Conservation Biology and Animal Conservation as well as college textbooks with such titles as Principles of
Conservation Biology and Essentials of Conservation Biology. However, because the underlying cause of the loss of
biodiversity is increasing human activity, conservation must inevitably involve human interactions. Many of the
techniques to prevent the loss of biodiversity involve issues of economics, law, social sciences, and religion-all of which
are covered by the journals and textbooks cited above.
