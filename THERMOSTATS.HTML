<h1 STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER;">SMART THERMOSTATS </h1>
<p style="margin-left:6px;">Smart thermostats are a quick way to improve home efficiency. These Wi-Fi-enabled devices
can be controlled remotely from smart devices and work with various heating and cooling
systems. They learn your preferences and adjust temperatures based on outside conditions,
even turning off when you're away and back on before you return. This helps cut energy usage,
reducing costs and reliance on fossil fuels.
